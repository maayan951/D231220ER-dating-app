137. Introduction:
     1. use reactive forms:
         * reactive form are build around observable streams.
         * but forms inputs and values can be accessed synchronously.
         * they are easy to test because they are detached from the html and act as separated objects.
         * all the cool kids are using reactive forms.
     2. use angualr validation for inputs.
     3. implement custom validators.
     4. implement resumable form controls (be a bit more DRY)
     5. working with Date inputs.
